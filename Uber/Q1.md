Q1:

we sort pairs by B from high to low.

given B[i] is the smallest b, we can only choose pairs before B[i] from the sorted arr because only those pairs have B[j]>=B[i]

if k is odd, we pick the largest k//2 nums and the smallest k//2 nums, depending on the sign of B[i], either largest -smallest or smallest-largest
if k is even, we either pick k//2-1 largest and k//2 smallest, or k//2 largest and k//2-1 smallest
```

```python
 A=[1,4,-3,4,-6,-4,6,7,8]
 B=[1,2,-4,5,-6,-7,2,1,2]
 
 k=3
 
 low,high=[],[]               # store the largest k//2 A[i] and the smallest k//2 A[i]
 th=tl=0                      # sum of the largest k//2 A[i] and  sum of the smallest k//2 A[i]
 res=float('-inf')
 for b,a in sorted(zip(B,A),reverse=True):          # sort pairs by B from high to low 
     if k%2: 
         res=max([res, (th-tl+a)*b,(tl-th+a)*b])    #  if b is negative, smallest minus the largest;  else, largest-smallest
        
     elif high and low:
         i,j=th-high[0]+a-tl,tl+low[0]+a-th
         res=max([res,i*b,-i*b,j*b,-j*b ])
         
     heapq.heappush(high,a)
     heapq.heappush(low,-a)
     th+=a
     tl-=-a    
     if len(high)>k//2:        
         th-=heapq.heappop(high)
     if len(low)>k//2:
         tl+=heapq.heappop(low) 
  return res
  ```
