## Statement

```
A delivery company wants to build a new service center in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new center in a position such that the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum.

Given an array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] is the position of the ith customer on the map, return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service center [xcentre, ycentre] such that the following formula is minimized:

Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.

Example 1:

![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/25/q4_e1.jpg)

```
Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4.00000
Explanation: As shown, you can see that choosing [xcentre, ycentre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.
```


Example 2

![example](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/25/q4_e3.jpg)

```
Input: positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]
Output: 2.82843
Explanation: The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843
 

Constraints:

1 <= positions.length <= 50
positions[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 100
```

## Solution

```
Simulated Annealing
Starting from a random point (here I use (0, 0)). We move around in 4 directions with some initial step (I used 100).

If we can find smaller total distance, we move to that point.

Otherwise, we set step /= 2.

We keep this iteration until the step is smaller than 1e-6.
```

```cpp
class Solution {
    double dist(vector<int> &a, vector<double> &b) {
        return sqrt(pow(a[0] - b[0], 2) + pow(a[1] - b[1], 2));
    }
    double all(vector<vector<int>> &A, vector<double> &p) {
        double ans = 0;
        for (auto &a : A) ans += dist(a, p);
        return ans;
    }
    const int dirs[4][2] = {{0,1},{0,-1},{-1,0},{1,0}};
public:
    double getMinDistSum(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        double ans = DBL_MAX;
        vector<double> p(2, 0);
        double step = 1000, eps = 1e-6;
        while (step > eps) {
            bool found = false;
            for (auto &dir : dirs) {
                vector<double> next = {p[0] + step * dir[0], p[1] + step * dir[1]};
                double d = all(A, next);
                if (d < ans) {
                    ans = d;
                    p = next;
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!found) step /= 2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
