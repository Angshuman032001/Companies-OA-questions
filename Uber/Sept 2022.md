### Q1
```
Given two non-empty strings str1 and str2, both the strings consist of only lowercase Latin letters. Your task is to calculate the number of different pairs of (a, b) such that a is a substring of str1, b is a subsequence of str2, and the content of a and b are the same.

A string s is called a substring of str, if you can form s from str by removing characters from the start and end of str. Two substrings str[x1...y1] and str[x2...y2] are considered different if x1 != x2 or y1 != y2.
For example - "uber" and "eats" are two different substrings of "ubereats" whereas "ubee" is not a substring.

A string s is called a subsequence of str, if you can form s from str by removing characters at any position of str. Two subsequences p and q are considered different if at least one character present in p has different position in the original string for the corresponding character in q.
For example - "ubee" and "ubea" are two different subsequences of "ubereats" whereas "uby" is not a subsequences.

Sample Input

str1 = "aa"
str2 = "aa"
Sample Output

5
Explanation

Following are the valid (a, b) pairs - 
(str1[1..1] str2[1..1])
(str1[1..1] str2[2..2])
(str1[2..2] str2[1..1])
(str1[2..2] str2[2..2])
(str1[1..2] str2[1..2])
[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
[input] string str1
The First Input string consists of lowercase Latin letters [1 <= length(str1) <= 2000]
[input] string str1
The Second Input string consists of lowercase Latin letters [1 <= length(str2) <= 2000]
[output] integer
```

### Q2

````
You are standing at the start of a very long road straight ahead. On the road, there are n cupcakes present. You are given the distance of each cupcake from the start of the road. Each of these distances is an integer, and multiple cupcakes can be present at the same distance from the start of the road.

You have to select 2 intervals of lengths k on the road and collect all the cupcakes that lie inside either of the intervals. The intervals are allowed to intersect. For example, for k = 3, the interval [1, 4] is a valid interval of length 3, and by choosing that interval, you can collect all the cupcakes that lie at a distance of 1, 2, 3 or 4 from the start of the road.

Find the maximum number of cupcakes that you can collect by picking 2 intervals as described as above.

Sample test case

n = 6
k = 1
distance = [1, 1, 2, 6, 8, 9]
expected output = 5

Explanation -

We can pick the 2 intervals [1, 2] and [8, 9]. Both these intervals have length of 1 and there are a total of 5 cupcakes that lie in these intervals

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)
[input] integer n
The number of cupcakes.
1 <= n <= 2 x (10^5)
[input] integer k
The length of the intervals that you can pick.
1 <= k <= 10^9
[input] array.integer distance
Array of n integers. The i th integer describes the distance of the i th cupcake from the start of the road.
1 <= Ai <= 10^9, where Ai s are NOT NECESSARILY DISTINCT.
[output] integer
The maximum number of cupcakes you can collect.
